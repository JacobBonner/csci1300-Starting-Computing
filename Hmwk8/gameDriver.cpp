/** Algorithm: Calculate the total score of the first four players of a team
 * 1. Initilize the total to zero.
 * 2. Loop through the team and add the scores of the first four players to the total.
 * 3. Return the total.
 * Input Parameters: a team (type Team)
 * Output: nothing
 * Returns: The sum of the scores of the first four players on a team (double)

/** Algorithm: Calculates the sum of the scores of the first four players of two teams, and returns the name of the team with more points.
 * 1. Check if either of the teams has less than 4 players.
 *      If yes, return "forfeit".
 * 2. If no...
 *      Calculate the total score for each team (the sum of the scores of the first four players).
 *      Check if the team totals are equal.
 *          If yes, return "draw".
 *      If no, check which team has a larger total score, and return the name of the team with the larger score.
 * Input Parameters: two teams (type Team)
 * Output: nothing
 * Returns: "forfeit" if one or both teams has less than 4 players, "draw" if both teams have the same total score, or the name of the team with a higher total score.
