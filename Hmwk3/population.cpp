/**
* Algorithm: Takes an inittial population and calculates the final population after 365 days (1 year)
* 1. Declare the number of seconds per year and calculate the value
* 2. Declare the birth, death, and immigration rates
* 3. Calculate the total births, deaths and immigrants in the year by multiplying the rates by the total number of seconds in a year
* 4. Calculate the final population by adding the total births and immigrants to the initial population (given as an argument to the function)
*    and by subracting the amount of deaths
* Input parameters: initial population (int)
* Output (prints to screen): nothing
* Returns: final population (int)
