/**
* Algorithm: Determines if a square with a given letter or number on a chessboard is black or white.
* 1. Take the letter and number passed into the function as parameters.
* 2. Check if the letter is 'a','c','e',or 'g'.
*       If yes...
*           2a. Check if the number is even, AND that it ranges from 1-8.
*               If yes, then print white.
*               2b. If no, check if the number is odd, AND that it ranges from 1-8.
*                   If yes, then print black.
*                   2c. If no, then print - Chessboard squares can only have letters between a-h and numbers between 1-8.
* 3. If no, check if the letter is 'b','d','f',or 'h'.
*       If yes...
*           3a. Check if the number is even, AND that it ranges from 1-8.
*               If yes, then print white.
*               3b. If no, check if the number is odd, AND that it ranges from 1-8.
*                   If yes, then print black.
*                   3c. If no, then print - Chessboard squares can only have letters between a-h and numbers between 1-8.
* 4. If no, then print - Chessboard squares can only have letters between a-h and numbers between 1-8.
* Input parameters: a letter (type char) and a number (type int)
* Output (prints to screen): different string based on different conditions - "black", "white", or 
*                            "Chessboard squares can only have letters between a-h and numbers between 1-8"
* Returns: nothing
