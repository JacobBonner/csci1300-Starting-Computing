/** Algorithm: Prints out a a list of books and authors, or prints out that the "library" is empty.
* 1. Take the three arguments passed into the function: array of titles, array of authors, and a number of books (int).
* 2. Check if the number of books is less than or equal to zero.
*       If yes, print out "No books are stored".
* 3. If not..
*       Print out "Here is a list of books".
*       Use variable i to loop from 0 to the number of books given.
*           Print out: the ith value of titles[] " by " the ith value of authors[]
* Input parameters: fileName (string), titles (array of strings), authors (array of strings), numBookStored (int), size (int)
* Output (prints to screen): title " by " author - for each index in the given arrays
* Returns: nothing
