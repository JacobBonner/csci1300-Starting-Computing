/** Algorithm: Prints out the book and author of each element in a books array, or prints out that the "library" is empty.
* 1. Take the two arguments passed into the function: Books books[], and numBooks (int)
* 2. Check if the number of books is less than or equal to zero.
*       If yes, print out "No books are stored".
* 3. If not..
*       Print out "Here is a list of books".
*       Use variable i to loop from 0 to the number of books given.
*           Print out: the book " by "  author, corresponding to the ith element of the books array
* Input parameters: books array (type Book), numBooks (int)
* Output (prints to screen): title " by " author - for each index in the books array
* Returns: nothing
